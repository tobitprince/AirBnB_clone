# AirBnB_clone
## Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…


Parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
